# SOEN6011-Project
This project is a Java-based application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to calculate the tangent of an angle given in radians. The application, designed for scientific computing purposes, demonstrates the implementation of the tan(x) function from scratch, avoiding the use of built-in Java libraries for trigonometric calculations.
